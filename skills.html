    <p> As stated before, I like sports a lot, so I would say that I 
 am really good at sports like soccer and football. I think I am 
a good critical thinker because I can make good decisions quickly 
 </p>
    <p> I think there are certain things I can teach people well. I can teach SHSAT and SAT really well. I did quite well on both tests, and I know good shortcuts and secrets to the test that others taught me.
